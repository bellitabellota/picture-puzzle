## Picture Puzzle App
This project is my realization of the [TOP's Photo Tagging App](https://zippy-velma-picture-puzzle-678a8073.koyeb.app/).

For deployment [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/) was used and the PostgreSQL database is run via [Neon](https://neon.com/), so that you can [try the app yourself](https://controversial-marigold-isaha-5a2faa70.koyeb.app/).

## Features
  -	A full-stack app integrating React with Rails via esbuild.
  -	3 different picture puzzles to solve.
  -	A frontend timer displaying the required time.
  -	Backend timer and backend validation of guess/game state to prevent players from hacking the game.
  -	Upon successful completion, players can enter their name to appear in the ranking.
  -	Tests for components and API controllers with Vitest and Rspec.
